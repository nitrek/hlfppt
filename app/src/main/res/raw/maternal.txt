<p>   <strong> Merrygold Health Network (MGHN) &ndash; UP</strong> </p>
<p> HLFPPT has devised a unique social franchising model under the brand name of Merrygold Health Network. MGHN delivers quality RCH services to urban slums and rural population, especially in low resource setting where public maternal healthcare delivery system are partially impaired and unable to deliver high quality 24 x 7 services to the last mile. We have been implementing the model in Uttar Pradesh since August 2007 in partnership with State Innovations in Family Planning Projects Services Agency (SIFPSA). <a class="readmore" href="merrygold-health-network.php">Read More</a></p>
<p>  <strong> MGHN &ndash; Rajasthan</strong> </p>
<p>  Rajasthan is reeling under the burden of preventable maternal deaths with an MMR of 318 as against the national average of 212[i] (SRS 2007-09). Its vast terrain comprising largely of deserts, extreme weather conditions coupled with socio-economic factors make access to quality maternal and child healthcare (MCH) a distant reality in remote hamlets and unaffordable in cities.. <a class="readmore" href="mghn-rajasthan.php">Read More</a></p>

<p> <strong>  PROJECT AMRIT</strong> </p>
<p>  Acute dehydration caused by loss of water and electrolytes during diarrhoea, if not contained timely, is one of the major causes of mortality among under-fives. However, most dehydration related deaths can be prevented by prompt administration of re-hydration solutions<strong>[i]</strong>. Therefore propagation of this intervention method is crucial not only for controlling diarrhoeal deaths, but also for contributing towards India's quest to reduce its U5MR (Under 5 Mortality Rate) from 55 at present to 38 by 2015, as set by the UN Millennium Development Goals<strong>[ii]</strong>. <a class="readmore" href="project_amrit.php">Read More</a></p>
