<p> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks not only the body, but also assaults the mind, soul and the basic right to &quot;dignity of life&quot;. The stigma associated with being &quot;HIV positive&quot; conveniently licenses the society to discriminate and deprives the infected person from basic care, support and treatment. With an estimated 2.1 million people living with HIV (PLHIV), India now ranks third on the global list of HIV prevalence. Female Sex Workers (FSWs), Men having Sex with Men (MSM), Transgender (TG) communities, Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), Migrant Workers, Truck Drivers are especially at higher risk who need to be made more aware of issues associated with HIV/AIDS.   </p>
<p> However, the truth remains that HIV doesn't mean death or end of all hopes. Early diagnosis, timely treatment and adoption of a healthy lifestyle can go a long way in managing the life of a PLHIV and in delaying the advancement of HIV into AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).   </p>
<p>HLFPPT has been at the forefront to address this issue and work towards containing HIV transmissions and facilitating a better life for PLHIVs. Over the last 22 years, it has collaborated with the government, NGOs, international agencies and local communities through various programme implementations, advocacy efforts, behaviour change communication campaigns, etc. It is working in tune with the objectives laid under the National AIDS Control Programme Phase IV (2012-17) which include: Reducing new infections by 50%; and Offering comprehensive care, support and treatment to all PLHAs. It is currently operational across 15 states with multiple programmes that are focussed on prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.  </p>
