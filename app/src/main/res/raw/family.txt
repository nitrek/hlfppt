<p>The ability to have a say in one's childbearing, in terms of &ndash; controlling the number of children one has as well as deciding on the sizeable gap between their births &ndash; is an incredible tool of empowerment for couples. Through provision of choices and awareness about contraception, family planning significantly reduces the vulnerabilities of unwanted or untimely pregnancies, unsafe abortions, poor maternal and child health, thus saving millions of lives and in a way also controlling population.</p>
<p> While family planning involves many interventions, our two decades of experience has taken us through the journey of a shifting focus from limiting methods (tubectomy and vasectomy) to spacing methods (Intrauterine Devices, Oral Contraceptive Pills and Condoms) which offer scope for changes according to the couple's varying needs for family planning over time. Also, we have experienced the growing need for expanding the basket of contraceptive choices which further empowers couples to make an informed decision about the size of their family.</p>
<p> HLFPPT has been both a witness as well as a contributor to this transition. Through various programmes, we are committed towards improving family planning across the spectrum. On the demand side, we are consistently working towards increasing contraceptive awareness and access among communities and adding to the basket of choices; while on the supply side we are committed towards building capacities of health providers in facilitating family planning services; creating network of affordable health facilities that reach out to the unserved communities and the like.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reproductive Health Framework Project: Ujjwal</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Capacity Building of HSPs on IUCD and Pregnancy Testing Card</strong></p>
<p>Ongoing since 2012 | 11 states | 190,659 IUCD insertions done and 20,263 HSPs trained till February 2015</p>
<p> Despite being a safe and effective spacing method for contraception, Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) has a very low prevalence rate in India. Limited training of medical officers and nursing personnel during medical education and prevailing myths around IUCD have often deterred its adoption at a higher scale. Having vast experience in capacity building programmes, HLFPPT is trying to address this gap by providing knowledge and skill-based training to HSPs on IUCD insertions and Pregnancy Testing Cards across multiple states. <a class="readmore" href="Pregnancy-Testing-Card.php">Read more</a></p>

<p>2010-2013 | Kanpur district (UP) | 6,525 CycleBeads sold | 40,000 population covered</p>
<p>Standard Days Method (SDM) is a natural family planning method which can be especially effective in regions with high fertility but low contraceptive prevalence, such as Kanpur, which had 22.4% unmet need for family planning (higher than the national average of 20.5%) and low 17.5% contraceptive prevalence rate in 2008. This highlighted the need for introducing SDM to the basket of choices.
