<p>  <p>With over two decades of experience, HLFPPT has amassed a wealth of knowledge in RCH. The Knowledge Management Division has the prime function of capturing, management, and dissemination of this knowledge so as to enable greater efficiency, replication of best practices, and reduce costly rework from project to project.</p>
<p>The division has undertaken ground work for creating a knowledge bank intended to be utilised both for internal learning and growth as well as for sharing with development partners. .</p>
<p><strong>Documentation Centre</strong></p>
<p>The Documentation Centre works with the objective &lsquo;to develop, archive and share HLFPPT&rsquo;s Projects, Best Practices and Models&rsquo;. It serves as a focal point for standardisation of programme documentation, facilitating research and publications and to support generation of evidence-based project communication and engaging corporate communication materials. .</p>
<p><strong>Samvad &ndash; Quarterly Corporate News Bulletin&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>One of the main outputs of the documentation centre is the release of Samvad, the corporate news bulletin, which features programme updates, case studies and significant events during the year. It is circulated internally as well as externally to all key stakeholders, development partners and to our contemporaries in the development arena. .</p>
<p><strong>Voices from the Field &ndash; Case Studies and Best Practices&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Given the width and depth of HLFPPT&rsquo;s experience, there are several models that have been time-tested and have emerged as best practices. The documentation and dissemination of these &lsquo;gold standards&rsquo; are key to organisational learning and growth. Case Studies, further, augment these learning by providing an insight into the process and analysis of the outcomes. .</p>
<p><strong>Reports &amp; Publications </strong></p>
<p>At KM Division, we support evidence-based reporting and publications. .</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;  Two annual reports for the IUCD programmes in UP and Assam were drafted for submission to the state NRHM. Based on the learning of the AMRIT project, a scale-up guide was developed and shared with UNICEF. NHSRC (NACO): HLFPPT was invited to contribute to the e-repository on HIV/AIDS hosted by NHSRC under NACO.  Project reports, IEC material, innovative audio-video tools were shared from a selection of our intervention in this area. These included Female Condom Programme, Condom Social Marketing Programme, PACT, MSM Programme and Life Skill Education Programme. .</li>

<p><strong>Repository &ndash; Warehouse of Knowledge </strong></p>
<p>A repository has been envisaged to be a readily accessible pool of knowledge that is made available to all members of the HLFPPT family. Thematic Area wise documents have been collected, namely Public Private Partnerships, Social Marketing, Technical Assistance &amp; Training and Research &amp; Knowledge Management. .</p>
<p><strong>Learning Day </strong></p>
<p>Learning Day is another innovative initiative to facilitate knowledge sharing and cross-learning. It is scheduled on the third Friday of each month, wherein sessions are conducted by in-house and external experts on various topics, in the areas of our operation. .</p>
<p><strong>Innovation Club </strong></p>
<p>The innovation club functions with the objective &ldquo;to document, showcase and encourage innovations in HLFPPT&rdquo;. Team members, co-opted from all divisions, have been mandated to identify and document innovations and best practices across projects and departments. Innovations, thus documented, are showcased through unique dissemination strategies; eg Vijay Divas to encourage innovation culture through recognising innovators. .</p></p>
